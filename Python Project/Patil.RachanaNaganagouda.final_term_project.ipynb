    "## Question 1\n",
    "### The CNN Moneyâ€™s Market Movers website (https://money.cnn.com/data/hotstocks/ ) tracks the most active stocks on a real time basis. Specifically, the most active, the top gainers and top losers are listed at any instance in time. You will first write Python scripts that collect the list of most actives, gainers and losers from the above website. Next, your programs should take the ticker symbols and names of these companies (and categories) and build a csv file (called stocks.csv) with data about each stock from the website: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMD?p=AMD&.tsrc=fin-srch-v1 which gives the quote for ticker symbol AMD as an example. The data to be collected from the Yahoo Finance site should include:\n",
    "### OPEN price\n",
    "### PREV CLOSE price\n",
    "### VOLUME\n",
    "### MARKET CAP\n",
    "### Your code should also list the names of the companies in the order and categories listed in the website: https://money.cnn.com/data/hotstocks/ and ask the user to choose a company to get the data on. Once the user chooses the company of interest, your program should display its corresponding data (Open, Prev Close, Volume and Market Cap).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The folllowing code works as:\n",
    "### The modules requests, bs4 and csv are imported. With the help of requests, the website mentioned below is accessed. Then the content of website is parsed with help of BeautifulSoup. The table is scraped with the help of required class name. The lists such as tickersymbols,fullnames and maintypes are initialised respectively. Any empty dictionary is initialised. A variable called counter is initialised to zero. With the help of csv writer the stocks .csv file is created and opened in write mode. The csv_writer is  a pointer which will help contents to be written in the file. The table variable consists of a list which contains contents of all three tables. The contents are accessed through 'for' loop one by one. Inside table, all rows are found out in the list. Inside each row, first column is scraped out. The abbreviated company names are appended to tickersymbols list whereas full names are appended to fullnames list. Then each abbreviated company name is given to the second website in the form of link and is navigated to that company page and scraped out required values as shown below. The values written to the csv file are the type of the stock, the abbreviated name, full name, previous value, open, volume and and market cap. all the values are wriiten in the csv file as a row . The counter is incremented to pint to the different stock type and same process goes on. The file is then closed after writing. Then the file is opened  in read mode to display the comapny names for the user to check through it. The contents are displayed accordingly. The user is prompted to enter the company name as per the list. If the comapny is mentioned in the list, The details are displayed else it prints company not found. "
